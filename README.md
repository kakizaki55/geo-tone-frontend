# About Geo Tone

**Geo Tone** is a browser-based audio sequencer built on React and supported by Reactronica, an incredible wrapper library for Tone.js made by [@unkleho](https://github.com/unkleho/reactronica).

This fork of [the original Geo Tone](https://github.com/geo-tone/geo-tone-frontend) (built by our small development team in spring 2022) also featured a backend using PostgreSQL and Express to store user-created projects, manage user data, and hash and encrypt information in a custom API. While these features will likely make a return in future updates, the original application proved challenging to navigate for first-time users - counter to our mission to make an easy-to-play, _accessible_ sequencer - so, we decided to open it up!

Our current approach - letting Geo Tone exist purely as a frontend tool - drives experimentation and makes new features easier to implement, too; here's an idea of what to expect in the near future:

- Freeform "piano-like" keyboard module (_in-progess_)
- Waveform visualizer
- Drum machine / sequencing
- Improved per-channel and global FX
- ...and more!

Most of all, **Geo Tone** exists to make music fun and visually-appearling - letting aspiring musicians and artists make dynamic, reactive, and unique audio-visual experiences all their own.
